This is a Python-based client-server application that allows you to transfer files over TCP/IP using sockets. The client can send image, CSV, and JSON files to the server, which can then visualize the files on the client side.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `socket`, `os`, `json`, `csv`, `PIL`

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tcp-file-transfer.git
